  "body": "Dear developers,\r\n    I actively use Brave browser to work on different operating systems. There is one significant problem\r\nwhich interfere with productive use of this product. The scroll speed on Linux is very slow and I can't configure it.\r\nSystem settings or graphical environment settings don't affect GTK applications like Brave.\r\nThere are two ways to solve this problem: imwheel and \"Chromium Wheel Smooth Scroller\" extension.\r\nUnfortunately, these solutions don't completely solve problem, but create additional inconvenience.\r\n    Web-pages are a specific type of document and you often need to look faster through them. \r\nThat's why scroll speed in browser needs to be higher than in other programs.\r\n    Could you please add a setting, which provides ability to change scroll speed by mouse wheel?\r\nThank you in advance!",

Because I don't see us doing any UI work for this.\r\n\r\nMy impression is that --scroll-pixels only affects wheel \"clicks\", not high-resolution-scrolling devices. Does anyone know if this is accurate? If so, that would at least make me happy. My experience has been that high-res touchpad behavior is consistent across OSs and only wheel clicks differ.",

      "body": "Just some thoughts about this on my end too.  I'm using Ubuntu 19.10 in a VM with VMware Workstation with a Logitech MX705 mouse.\r\n\r\nIn Firefox, there are various `about:config` settings which I'm setting as follows:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nuser_pref(\"mousewheel.system_scroll_override_on_root_content.enabled\", true);\r\nuser_pref(\"mousewheel.system_scroll_override_on_root_content.horizontal.factor\", 150);\r\nuser_pref(\"mousewheel.system_scroll_override_on_root_content.vertical.factor\", 150);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese make Firefox absolutely perfect on the scrolling front.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned Brave (and all Chromium-based browsers) have very slow scrolling on Linux out of the box.  Even when using the extension linked above, the scrolling is not anywhere near as responsive as Firefox.\r\n\r\nOften when I move the scroll wheel slowly (one click), Chrome / Brave don't scroll at all while Firefox always does.\r\n\r\nThe extension sadly is not the answer here, it doesn't work well enough imho\r\n\r\nAnother point is that many other apps (e.g. Sublime Text, VS Code, Terminal) all scroll really well and much faster relative to Chromium.  So a global GTK setting won't really suffice.\r\n\r\nHaving an option in Preferences of Brave would be an absolutely lifesaver for all Linux users.  Alternatively the default mouse wheel speed could be adjusted to be more like Windows or macOS out of the box.\r\n\r\nHuge love and thanks\r\nFotis",

I'm using Ubuntu 19.10 in a VM with VMware Workstation with a Logitech MX705 mouse.\r\n\r\nIn Firefox, there are various `about:config` settings which I'm setting as follows:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nuser_pref(\"mousewheel.system_scroll_override_on_root_content.enabled\", true);\r\nuser_pref(\"mousewheel.system_scroll_override_on_root_content.horizontal.factor\", 150);\r\nuser_pref(\"mousewheel.system_scroll_override_on_root_content.vertical.factor\", 150);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese make Firefox absolutely perfect on the scrolling front.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned Brave (and all Chromium-based browsers) have very slow scrolling on Linux out of the box.  Even when using the extension linked above, the scrolling is not anywhere near as responsive as Firefox.\r\n\r\nOften when I move the scroll wheel slowly (one click), Chrome / Brave don't scroll at all while Firefox always does.\r\n\r\nThe extension sadly is not the answer here, it doesn't work well enough imho\r\n\r\nAnother point is that many other apps (e.g. Sublime Text, VS Code, Terminal) all scroll really well and much faster relative to Chromium.  So a global GTK setting won't really suffice.\r\n\r\nHaving an option in Preferences of Brave would be an absolutely lifesaver for all Linux users.  Alternatively the default mouse wheel speed could be adjusted to be more like Windows or macOS out of the box.\r\n\r\nHuge love and thanks\r\nFotis",

My current workaround is using `libinput-multiplier` [from AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libinput-multiplier/), and wrapping the `.desktop` file in `/usr/share/applications` (KDE) with `echo 3 > /tmp/libinput_discrete_deltay_multiplier;` and `;echo 1 > /tmp/libinput_discrete_deltay_multiplier`. Still, not the best solution consindering `libinput-multiplier` affects the entire OS as long as Brave is running (and, in my case, it's running basically always).\r\n\r\ndo you know if it possible to use it outside of arch for their git or someting (used arch before so i'm not affraid of terminal) just to know ?",

When I place chromium and brave side-by-side, a single scroll moves further down the page on chromium compared to brave. \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7101704e-8e15-473c-bae7-a478b41d270f)\n\nEven more annoyingly, when first gaining focus a single detent of the mouse wheel does nothing on brave, while chromium always responds to the first detent. If I repeatedly lose and regain focus on the window, a single detent scroll wilu perpetually do nothing. \n\nBrowser versions for reference:\n\nChromium: \nVersion 136.0.7103.113 (Official Build) built on Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm) (64-bit)\n\nBrave: \n[Brave 1.79.123 (Official Build) (64-bit)](https://brave.com/latest/)\nChromium: 137.0.7151.104\n\nSeems brave is built from a newer version of chromium.",
